## Internship
CodeSoft AI Internship

## Project Title
Recommendation System

## Objective
To build a simple recommendation system that suggests movies to users
based on their preferences using content-based filtering.

## Description
This project uses movie genres to recommend similar movies.
Cosine similarity is used to calculate similarity between movies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Content-Based Filtering)

## How It Works
1. Movie genres are converted into numerical vectors
2. Cosine similarity is calculated
3. Movies with highest similarity are recommended

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Run the program:
   python recommendation.py

## Sample Output
User enters a movie name and the system recommends similar movies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic recommendation system using
machine learning concepts and is suitable for beginners.
